Regularised iterative reconstruction
************************************
This tutorial covers the main contribution of ToMoBAR - the advanced model-based
iterative reconstruction with regularisation. It is the `plug-and-play` functionality
of model-based methods makes them versatile for different types of data with
various noise models and artefacts. On the other hand, it can be difficult to
find the optimal solution (even when it formally exists) by tediously sweeping through
multiple parameters. We suggest here to check various **Demos** provided,
as well as this more compact tutorial.


We start by defining a 3D projection data Numpy array of unsigned integer 16-bit data type (optional)
and with axes labels given as :mod:`["detY", "angles", "detX"]`. We also provide the corresponding flats and darks fields
(also 3D arrays of the same axes order).

* The first step is to normalise :mod:`dataRaw` using the :mod:`normaliser` function from :mod:`tomobar.supp.suppTools.normaliser`.

.. code-block:: python

    from tomobar.supp.suppTools import normaliser

    data_norm = normaliser(dataRaw, flats, darks, log=True, method="mean", axis=1)

* Instantiate the iterative reconstructor :mod:`tomobar.methodsIR`:

.. code-block:: python

    from tomobar.methodsIR import RecToolsIR


    detectorVert, angles_number, detectorHoriz = np.shape(data_norm)

    Rectools = RecToolsIR(
        DetectorsDimH=detectorHoriz,  # Horizontal detector dimension
        DetectorsDimH_pad=0,  # Padding size of horizontal detector
        DetectorsDimV=detectorVert,  # Vertical detector dimension
        CenterRotOffset=0.0,  # Center of Rotation (needs to be found)
        AnglesVec=angles_rad,  # A vector of projection angles in radians
        ObjSize=detectorHoriz,  # The reconstructed object dimensions
        datafidelity="LS",  # Data fidelity, choose from LS, KL, PWLS and SWLS
        device_projector="gpu",  # Device to perform reconstruction on
    )

* Now we have an access to all methods of this particular reconstructor.
  There are two advanced model-based reconstruction methods available:
  FISTA and ADMM. The former one is significantly more flexible than the latter,
  so we recommend it. FISTA has been also accelerated with Ordered-Subsets and
  requires less memory than ADMM to solve the sub-problem for the data-fidelity term.

  **Please note that the dictionaries needed for all iterative methods with exact
  keyword arguments defined in** :mod:`tomobar.supp.dicts`.

.. code-block:: python

    _data_ = {
        "projection_norm_data": data_norm,
        "data_axes_labels_order": ["detY", "angles", "detX"],
    }  # data dictionary

    lc = Rectools.powermethod(_data_)  # calculate Lipschitz constant

    _algorithm_ = {"iterations": 300, "lipschitz_const": lc}  # algorithm dict

    _regularisation_ = {
        "method": "PD_TV",  # Selected regularisation method
        "regul_param": 0.000002,  # Regularisation parameter
        "iterations": 150,  # The number of inner regularisation iterations
        "device_regulariser": "gpu",
    }

    FISTA_Rec = Rectools.FISTA(_data_, _algorithm_, _regularisation_)


* Let us consider a faster and slightly more advanced modification of the FISTA algorithm -
  Penalised Weighted Least Squares (PWLS) Ordered-Subsets FISTA with Total Variation regularisation and WAVELETS
  thresholding (note that `pypwt` package needed for wavelets, see :ref:`ref_dependencies`).

.. code-block:: python

    from tomobar.methodsIR import RecToolsIR

    detectorVert, angles_number, detectorHoriz = np.shape(data_norm)

    Rectools = RecToolsIR(
        DetectorsDimH=detectorHoriz,  # Horizontal detector dimension
        DetectorsDimH_pad=0,  # Padding size of horizontal detector
        DetectorsDimV=detectorVert,  # Vertical detector dimension
        CenterRotOffset=0.0,  # Center of Rotation (needs to be found)
        AnglesVec=angles_rad,  # A vector of projection angles in radians
        ObjSize=detectorHoriz,  # The reconstructed object dimensions
        datafidelity="PWLS",  # Data fidelity, choose from LS, KL, PWLS and SWLS
        device_projector="gpu",  # Device to perform reconstruction on
    )

    _data_ = {
        "projection_norm_data": data_norm,  # Normalised projection data
        "projection_raw_data": dataRaw,  # Raw projection data
        "OS_number": 6,  # The number of ordered-subsets
        "data_axes_labels_order": ["detY", "angles", "detX"],
    }

    lc = Rectools.powermethod(_data_)

    _algorithm_ = {"iterations": 25, "lipschitz_const": lc}

    _regularisation_ = {
        "method": "PD_TV_WAVELETS",  # Selected regularisation method
        "regul_param": 0.000002,  # Regularisation parameter for PD-TV
        "regul_param2": 0.000002,  # Regularisation parameter for wavelets
        "iterations": 30,  # The number of regularisation iterations
        "device_regulariser": "gpu",
    }

    FISTA_OS_PWLS_Rec = Rectools.FISTA(_data_, _algorithm_, _regularisation_)


There are hundreds of different data fidelities and regularisation combinations possible in ToMoBAR.
Please note, however, that before using a certain combination of data and prior terms, its worth knowing
approximately what could be the problem with your data. For instance, you might want to know what is your
reconstructed object characteristics (geometry, texture etc.) and if your data contains noise, zingers, stripes, or/and other
data inaccuracies? See an example in :ref:`examples_synth_iter`.

One can also operate purely on CuPy arrays if :ref:`ref_dependencies` are satisfied for the CuPy package.
For that one needs to use :mod:`tomobar.methodsIR_CuPy` class instead of :mod:`tomobar.methodsIR`. Note that the array of angles for the CuPy modules should be provided as a Numpy array.
