        <br><font size="3" face="verdana" color="green"><b> ToMoBAR</b> is a Python and Matlab (not currently maintained) library of direct and model-based regularised iterative reconstruction algorithms with a plug-and-play capability. ToMoBAR offers you a selection of various data models and regularisers resulting in complex objectives for tomographic reconstruction. ToMoBAR can handle multi-GPU parallel reconstruction in Python and also device-to-device methods operating on CuPy arrays. </font></br>

### NEW in ToMoBAR v.2025.08:
- $\sf\color{red}Breaking$ $\sf\color{red}changes!$ The API for initializing geometry in both direct and iterative methods (the `RecTools` class) has been updated. A new parameter, `DetectorsDimH_pad`, has been [introduced](https://dkazanc.github.io/ToMoBAR/api/tomobar.methodsDIR.html) to control edge padding along the detector's horizontal dimension. This parameter can help reduce circular/arc [artifacts](https://dkazanc.github.io/ToMoBAR/tutorials/real_data_recon.html) in reconstructions, such as saturated circles or arcs. See updated [Tutorials](https://dkazanc.github.io/ToMoBAR/tutorials/direct_recon.html) and [Demos](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/tree/master/Demos/Python).
- Log-Polar method (`FOURIER_INV` in `RecToolsDIRCuPy`) has been further accelerated and it is significantly faster FBP.
